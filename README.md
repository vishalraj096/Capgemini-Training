# Java Arrays – Level 1 & Level 2 Lab Practice

## Date

**31_03_2025**

## Overview

On this date, we practiced **Java Arrays Level 1 and Level 2 lab programs** to understand how arrays are used to store, process, and manipulate multiple values efficiently in Java.

These exercises helped strengthen problem-solving skills using **1D arrays, 2D arrays, loops, and input validation**, following proper Java programming standards.

## Level 1 – Learning Summary

Level 1 focuses on **basic array concepts and simple real-world problems**.

**Outcome:**  
Developed a strong foundation in using arrays to solve basic computational problems efficiently.

---

## Level 2 – Learning Summary

Level 2 builds on Level 1 by introducing **complex logic, dynamic arrays, and real-world scenarios**.

**Outcome:**  
Improved ability to handle complex problems involving multiple arrays, validations, and calculations.

---

## Programming Practices Followed

- All values stored in variables
- No hard-coded values
- Meaningful variable and class names
- Proper indentation and readability
- Comments for logical blocks
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Usage of array `length` property
- One class per program
- Scanner object closed after use

---

## Conclusion

These Array-based exercises strengthened our understanding of **data storage, iteration, and logical problem-solving in Java**.  
They provide a solid foundation for **Object-Oriented Programming, lab exams, viva, and interview preparation**.
