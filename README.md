## Date

**31_12_2025**

## Overview

On this date, we practiced **Level 1 and Level 2 Java Programming Elements** to understand and apply core Java fundamentals by solving lab-based problems.

---

## Level 1 – Learning Summary

- Basics of Java program structure
- Use of variables and data types
- Arithmetic operations and formulas
- Percentage, profit/loss calculations
- Unit conversions (km–miles, cm–feet/inches)
- Writing clean output statements

**Outcome:**  
Built confidence in writing simple Java programs using proper coding standards.

---

## Level 2 – Learning Summary

- Taking user input using `Scanner`
- Calculator logic using arithmetic operators
- Area, distance, and conversion problems
- Quotient and remainder calculations
- Integer vs double operations
- Understanding operator precedence

**Outcome:**  
Learned to handle user input and perform multiple computations in a structured way.

---

## Programming Practices Followed

- No hard-coded values
- Meaningful variable and class names
- Proper indentation and readability
- One class per program
- Output as per problem statement

---

## Conclusion

These exercises helped strengthen Java fundamentals and prepared us for **lab exams, viva, and further OOP concepts**.

# Java Control Flow – Level 1, Level 2 & Level 3 Lab Practice

## Date

**02_01_2026**

## Overview

On this date, we completed **Java Control Flow Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 lab practice programs**.
